It uses the 7zip bash program to unzip files\r\ndirectly into nemory and than convert them to arrays\r\n\r\nIt is directed to treat the image files that were sent on kaggle competition CIFAR\r\nbut it may be changed to deal with other zipped files.\r\n\r\nOn the first test, if I had to decompress and read each file, it would take 2 hours to complete.\r\n\r\nUsing this library, it took 1 minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n### references and places to find help\r\n\r\n[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/646286/python-pil-how-to-write-png-image-to-string](Stack post)\r\n[https://docs.python.org/2/library/stringio.html](String io)\r\n[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11552926/how-to-read-raw-png-from-an-array-in-python-opencv/17547525#17547525](Open cv and raw image)\r\n[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25186591/having-cv2-imread-reading-images-from-file-objects-or-memory-stream-like-data-h](Memory strings as files)\r\n[http://superuser.com/questions/548349/how-can-i-install-7zip-so-i-can-run-it-from-terminal-on-os-x](how to intall 7zip)\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\nJust copy the directory to the same directory where your original code is.\r\n\r\nThen:\r\n```\r\n    import 7z_on_array\r\n\r\n    file_name = '~/Machine Learning/Kaggle/CIFAR/train.7z'\r\n    f_info = get_files_info(file_name)\r\n    raw_data = uncompress_file(file_name)\r\n    data = get_files_array(f_info, raw_data)\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
